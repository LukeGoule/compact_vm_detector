# compact_vm_detector
Smaller version of [pafish](https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish) designed to be embedded into other Windows C++ apps.
This will obviously not be nearly as effective as pafish if you're looking to research malware techniques (and hopefully not write your own malware!), so I'd recommend checking out the pafish source for a more in depth look at virtualisation detection. Pafish is written in Linux style C meaning it will not be able to compile using VC++ on Windows, you will need MinGW.
